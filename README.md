CSCI 4250 speech recognition group project

The speech recognition code came from "https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/".
This is a speech recognition library for Python that can be installed using the command "pip install SpeechRecognition".
The link also contains publicly accessible library reference documents and examples on how to use the library.

We are creating the snake game ourselves using the Pygame library, located at "https://pypi.org/project/pygame/".

Milestone 1: We created a basic snake game that implemented voice recognition software. We created a start screen where the user can say start to play the game. On the game screen, the snake responds to voice commands such as up, down, left, and right. We spent plenty of time working with the speech recognition library and setting it up properly.

Milestone 2: We added an option to view instructions, and we also added an end screen for after the game is over. We started to implement more elements from our design documentation in order to make the game look more presentable and appealing to the player. Screens have more than just a black background.

Milestone 3: We added a basic pause functionality and continued to iterate on our overall design. We tried to make the voice recognition more responsive because sometimes it would not recognize commands very well. We also added a score element.

Milestone 4: We improved the pause feature, and we added an option for the player to change their snake color on the start screen. We worked on both improving the overall design as well as trying to improve the voice recognition by reducing the delay between the player speaking and the command taking effect.
