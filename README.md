CSCI 4250 speech recognition group project

The speech recognition code came from "https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/".
This is a speech recognition library for Python that can be installed using the command "pip install SpeechRecognition".
The link also contains publicly accessible library reference documents and examples on how to use the library.

We are creating the snake game ourselves using the Pygame library, located at "https://pypi.org/project/pygame/".
